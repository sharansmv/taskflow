# Replit Development Request: Taskflow - A Modern Goal-Oriented Daily Planner Web App

## Project Overview
I need help building "Taskflow," a Sunsama-inspired digital daily planner that helps users manage goals, tasks, calendars, and communications in one unified interface. The app is primarily a goal management tool that translates high-level intentions into daily actions. The app should be a Progressive Web App (PWA) with its own backend and database, featuring a modern, minimal design with both light and dark modes.

## Core Requirements

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or NextAuth.js
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context API or Redux for client state
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify for frontend, backend deployable to Heroku or similar

### Key Functionality
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Email/password login
   - OAuth with Google only

2. **Calendar Integration** (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
   - Deep bi-directional sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud
   - Visual timeline representation of the day/week
   - Ability to block time for tasks directly in the calendar
   - Automatic task scheduling based on calendar availability
   - Calendar event creation from tasks
   - Multiple calendar support with custom color coding
   - Meeting preparation reminders
   - Buffer time settings between calendar events
   - Conflict detection and resolution

3. **Goal Management System**:
   - Hierarchical goal structure (long-term, monthly, weekly, daily)
   - Goal progress tracking and visualization
   - Connect tasks to specific goals to measure progress
   - Weekly goal review process with insights
   - Goal templates for recurring objectives
   - Time budgeting by goal category
   - Performance metrics against goal targets

4. **Integration Framework**:
   - Modular system to connect with external APIs
   - Todoist integration only for external task management
   - Google Calendar for calendar management
   - Gmail integration
   - Webhooks system for real-time updates
   - API rate limiting and backoff strategies
   - Conflict resolution for synced items

5. **Core Features**:
   - Unified daily view dashboard
   - Task management with duration estimates
   - Kanban board view for daily tasks organization
   - Custom task views (by priority, deadline, goal, etc.)
   - Daily planning workflow
   - Focus mode
   - Drag-and-drop interface throughout the app

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clean, minimal interface with abundant white space
   - Smooth animations for transitions
   - Fully responsive design that works on mobile
   - Dark/light mode toggle with system preference detection
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Data Model (Simplified)
- **Users**: Authentication details, preferences, connected accounts
- **Goals**: Title, description, category, timeframe, progress metrics, deadline, priority, parent/child relationships
- **Tasks**: Title, description, estimated duration, actual duration, status, source, external ID, associated goal
- **TimeBlocks**: Scheduled task time, linked calendar events, buffer settings
- **DailyPlans**: Collection of tasks, time blocks, and notes for a specific day
- **WeeklyPlans**: High-level goals for the week, time budgets, priority areas
- **Integrations**: API credentials, sync status, user mappings
- **KanbanBoards**: Custom board configurations, column definitions, card mappings

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 - Core Experience (MVP)
- Auth system
- Goal management framework
- Comprehensive calendar integration (highest priority)
- Daily task view with Kanban board option
- Manual task creation and management
- Goal-to-task relationship mapping
- Light/dark mode
- Responsive layout

### Phase 2 - Integrations & Planning
- Todoist integration for external tasks
- Gmail integration
- Two-way sync with external tools
- Daily and weekly planning workflows
- Goal progress tracking
- Time budgeting features

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- Focus mode
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Goal achievement forecasting
- Offline support (PWA)
- Additional integrations
- Team goal sharing
- Advanced Kanban customization

## Design Guidelines
- **Visual Style**: Clean, minimal, with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Color Palette**: Neutral base with accent colors for categorization
- **Typography**: Sans-serif system fonts for optimal performance
- **Layout**: Card-based components, with clear visual hierarchy
- **Motion**: Subtle, purposeful animations for state changes

## Additional Notes
- Prioritize a fast, responsive experience even with multiple integrations
- Design the system for extensibility to add more integrations later
- Implement proper error handling and sync conflict resolution
- Ensure data privacy and security, especially for email and calendar data
- Consider implementing a local-first approach with cloud sync for reliability

Let me know if you need any clarification or have suggestions to improve this project plan. I'm open to technical recommendations that might make implementation more efficient or effective.
